# qrolln

## Project Overview
Our final project took on the example of a QR code class attenedance mechanism. It is responsible for providing an instructor with the ability to generate a QR code to track a weeks attendance. Once students successfully scan the code and verify their identity, they will be added to the list of students for that week. Instructors will be able to see student name and ID.
